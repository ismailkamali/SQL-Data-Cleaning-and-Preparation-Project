This is a data cleaning project done on MySQL to prepare data for a follow up data analysis project. 
I have created this project to practise and implement SQL skills such as: syntax, joins, CTEs, updating tables, data formatting, etc.
I am eager to implement this project into a follow up project which will be an exploratory data analysis project in MySQL.
I followed tutorials from https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst for guidance and inspiration.
Although a guided project, the skills and functions used were based off previous lessons by the same YouTube channel. 
While I followed the steps provided, I also applied my own modifications and comments to reinforce and deepen my understanding of SQL.
